#+Title: The C Programming Language Answers

Because I haven't learned the C programming language systematically
 before (only learned some C++) and in this semester we have some 
courses like OS, Embedded Systems that need programming in C,
 I decide to use this book to learn some C stuff :)

This repository contains codes and answers to the book /The C Programming Language/, also known as *K&R C*.
