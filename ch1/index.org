** Exercise 1-1
Declare a =main()= function without explicitly providing a return type will make the compiler produce a warning,
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
hello.c:3:1: warning: type specifier missing, defaults to 'int' [-Wimplicit-int]
#+END_SRC
Without the first line (not include the stdio library), it can still be compiled and run (print hello, world!)! It seems that the compiler automatically produce a prototype for printf.

** Exercise 1-2
The compiler uttered a warning but the program can still run correctly.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
hello.c:6:13: warning: unknown escape sequence '\c' [-Wunknown-escape-sequence]
#+END_SRC


** Exercise 1-3
#+INCLUDE: "ex1_3.c" src c
In the terminal, enter
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$cc ex1_3.c
$./a.out
#+END_SRC
The result would be
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
